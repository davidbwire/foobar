 “If you have $200 in your pocket, and you see a shelf with a long row of foobars priced at $1, $1.2, $1.44, $1.728 and so forth. Every foobar costs 20% more than the previous one. You buy one of each foobar, starting with the one that costs $1, until you can't afford the next foobar on the shelf (the foobars are ordered by price). How many foobars can you buy, and how much change will you get?”
